Made in C++ using SDL2 to provide pixel-level graphics access.

## Why?

I made this project as an experiment to learn C++ and explore the low level graphics API it provides.

## How?

This implementation use simple trig equations with randomness to move around particles in an elegant spiral, cycling through different colors.
